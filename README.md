# Employee Salary Prediction

## Overview

This project shows how to use Python to create a basic salary prediction model.  To learn more about employee wages, the notebook investigates employee data, stores it in a lightweight SQLite database, analyzes the data using Pandas, and uses data visualization tools.
As a student project, it is lightweight and simple to use while demonstrating real-world data science operations.

## Features

Creation of a simple data warehouse with SQLite3 and Pandas

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Building a basic salary prediction model

Visualization of key salary-related trends

Tech Stack

Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

SQLite3
